Description 
*************

* Giotto provides a flexible framework for common single-cell processing steps such as:
   
  * Quality control
  * Normalization
  * Dimension reduction
  * Clustering and cell type annotation
  
* To facilitate the analysis of recently emerging high-throughput, but lower-resolution spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as 10X Genomics Visium and Slide-seq, Giotto has 3 implemented algorithms for estimating the spatial enrichment of different cell types by integration of known gene signatures or single-cell RNAseq expression and annotation data.
* Spatial information is retained through the formation of a spatial grid and/or a spatial proximity network, which is used to:
  
  * Identify spatial genes
  * Extract continuous spatial-expression patterns
  * Identify discrete spatial domains using HMRF
  * Explore cell-type/cell-type spatial interaction enrichment or depletion
  * Calculate spatially increased ligand-receptor expression in cells of interacting cell type pairs
  * Find interaction changed genes (ICG): genes that change expression in one cell type due to interaction with a neighboring cell type

* Giotto provides a number of options to visualize both 2D and 3D data and the outcome of Giotto can be interactively explored using :bdg-link-success:`Giotto Viewer <http://spatial.rc.fas.harvard.edu/giotto-viewer/>` which allows you to overlay the obtained results with raw or additional images of the profiled tissue section(s).

Installation
*************
Giotto is installed via R **but there are required Python modules** which **must** be installed in order for Giotto to function properly. 
Below are the instructions for both the Giotto Package Installation (Part 1) done via R and the Installation of Required Python Modules (Part 2). 
In order to use Giotto successfully, users **must** have both the Giotto Package installed as well as the required Python Packages. 

.. important:: 

	Make sure that your system has satisfied **all** of the requirements needed to sucessfully install Giotto.

For ease of acces, there is a method which allows users to automatically install all of the necessary python modules from within R (see Part 2.2 Giotto-Specific Python Packages for more information). 

:octicon:`light-bulb` Checkout out the :ref:`Common Errors and Solutions <faqs>` for more troubleshooting tips on common installation issues.  

.. _GiottoInstallationWorkflow:

Giotto Installation Workflow
==============================

.. tab-set:: 

	.. tab-item:: Giotto Installation Workflow 

		This workflow image is designed to help with Giotto Installation. 
		Users should follow the installation process by answering Yes or No to the following quetions. 
		There are three potential paths aimed to guide users through the installation process (see the diagram below for an overview).

Part 2: Python Giotto Requirements 
=======================================

.. tab-set:: 

	.. tab-item:: 2.1: Python Package Installation 

		:octicon:`question` **Have you ever installed a Python Package?**

		.. dropdown:: Yes

			:octicon:`arrow-right` Move on to the next step: Giotto-Specific Python Packages 

		.. dropdown:: No 

			Information on how to install a Python package can be found `here`_.
			Once you have read through the information :octicon:`arrow-right` proceeed to the next step: Giotto-Specific Python Packages. 


	.. tab-item:: 2.2: Giotto-Specific Python Packages

		:octicon:`question` **Have you installed the python modules necessary for Giotto to run?**
		
		.. dropdown:: Required Modules 

			To perform all potential steps and analysis in the Giotto spatial toolbox the user needs to have a number of python modules installed. 
			To make this process as flexible and easy as possible two different strategies can be used

			* pandas
			* python-igraph (igraph)
			* networkx
			* leidenalg
			* python-louvain (community)
			* smfishHmrf
			* python.app (**OSX only**)
			* scikit-learn

			:octicon:`alert` These are necessary to run all available analyses, but can be installed automatically (see **2.2A Automatic Installation**) or manually (see **2.2B Manual Installation**) explained in detail below (Reponse "No").

		.. dropdown:: Yes 

			:octicon:`arrow-right` Move on to the next step: Python Path Specification 

		.. dropdown:: No
			:open:

			There are two methods through which users may install the required python modules ('Automatic Installation' vs. 'Manual Installation')
			
			.. dropdown:: 2.2A: Automatic Installation 

				The python modules will be installed automatically in a miniconda environment when installing Giotto. However, it will ask you whether you want to install them and you can opt out and select your preferred python path. In that case you need to do a manual installation of the python modules.
				To perform all potential steps and analysis in the Giotto spatial toolbox the user needs to have a number of python modules installed. Installation of the Giotto Environment allows users to install the required Python environment via MiniConda without specifying their python path. 
				
				With this option, the user can just install a Giotto python environment using r-miniconda. This is done *after* installation of the Giotto package via R (see Part 1: Giotto Installation for more information).  

				First, load the Giotto Package then proceed to environment installation and/or removal. 

				.. code-block::

					library(Giotto)

				.. dropdown:: Install Giotto Environment 

					.. code-block::

						installGiottoEnvironmnt()

				.. dropdown:: Re-Install the Giotto environment

					.. code-block::

						installGiottoEnvironment(force_environment = TRUE)

				.. dropdown:: Re-install mini-conda and environment

					.. code-block::
						
						installGiottoEnvironment(force_miniconda = TRUE)
					
				.. dropdown:: Remove Giotto Environment

					.. code-block::

						removeGiottoEnvironment()

				.. note::
					With the automatic installation option, the user **DOES NOT** have to specify a python path. 
				

			.. dropdown:: 2.2B: Manual Installation

				There are two methods thorugh which users can install the necessary Python modules manually with **(1) Pip in Python3** or **(2) Conda**.

				.. warning:: 
					With either one of the **Manual Installation** options (**Install with Pip in Python3** or **Install with Conda**) users will have to provide the python path to :ref:`createGiottoInstructions <createGiottoInstructions>`. 
					If this is not done, Giotto **will not** be able to use the installed python modules.
					
				*Note:* If pip install does not work, try installing the modules within a `conda environment <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands>`_. For more inforomation on vitual environments with conda visit this `page <https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/creating-python-virtual-environments-with-conda-why-and-how-180ebd02d1db>`_.

				.. dropdown:: **1. Install with Pip in Python3**

					*For OSX, Windows, or Linux:* 

					.. code-block:: 

						pip3 install pandas python-igraph networkx python-louvain leidenalg scikit-learn smfishHmrf

				.. dropdown:: **2. Install with Conda**

					1. Create yaml file (e.g. environment.yml) with the following information:

						.. code-block:: 

							name: giotto_env
							channels:
							— defaults
							dependencies:
							— pip=3.4
							— pandas
							— networkx
							- python-igraph
							- leidenalg
							- python-louvain
							- python.app (!!only for OSX!!)
							- scikit-learn
							prefix: /Users/your_username/anaconda3/envs/giotto_env

					2. Create Conda Environment Based on yaml File: 

						.. code-block:: 

							conda env create -f environment.yml
					
					3. Use the path to this environment when you create the Giotto instructions or Giotto object

						.. dropdown:: For OSX
						
							.. code-block::
							
								/Users/your_username/anaconda3/envs/giotto_env/bin/pythonw


						.. dropdown:: For Windows
						
							.. code-block:: 
							
								/Users/your_username/anaconda3/envs/giotto_env/python.exe


						.. dropdown:: For Linux
						
							.. code-block:: 
							
								/Users/your_username/anaconda3/envs/giotto_env/bin/python


			.. warning:: 
				With either one of the Manual Installation options users **must** specify their Python path. 

			Please :octicon:`arrow-right` move on to the next step: 2.3 Python Path Specification 

	.. tab-item:: 2.3 Python Path Specification 

		:octicon:`question` **Have you specified your python path in R?**

		.. note::
			
			With the Manual Installation option, once the user has installed all of the necessary modules, via either of the methods (e.g. Conda), the path to their python environment can be provided as an instruction in R.

		.. dropdown:: Yes

			You can now start using Giotto :octicon:`verified` 

		.. dropdown:: No 

				With the Manual Installation option, once the user has installed all of the necessary modules, via either of the methods above (e.g. Conda), the path to their python environment can be provided as an instruction in R.

				.. code-block::
						
						# Within R
					
						library(Giotto)
						my_instructions = createGiottoInstructions(python_path = 'your/python/path')
						my_giotto_object = createGiottoObject(
							raw_exprs = '...',
							spatial_locs = '...', 
							instructions = my_instructions)

				You can now start using Giotto :octicon:`verified`

HowTos
*******
Giotto provides a lot of analyses, visualizations and other options to facilitate your spatial dataset analysis. We are working on providing easy-to-understand examples or tutorials, but if anything is not clear or if there is something you would like to see in particular, then do not hesitate to `contact us.`_

In addition to our HowTos we have also created a way for users to test out Giotto via :bdg-ref-warning-line:`Docker <DockerInformation>` or :bdg-ref-primary-line:`Binder <BinderInformation>` (see :ref:`Try Giotto <TryGiotto>` for more information).
